# Portfolio

This is my personal [Portfolio](https://mijust.net) created with Next.js using `create-next-app`. The project demonstrates modern web technologies and a responsive user interface. It utilizes optimized fonts using `next/font` (specifically the Geist font family by Vercel).

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my portfolio. It offers a rapid development cycle and an easy way to see changes live in the browser. The application is designed to function optimally on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies

* **Next.js** – Framework for server-side rendering and static websites
* **React** – For creating components and user interfaces
* **next/font** – Automatic optimization and loading of modern fonts (Geist)
* **Node.js** – Runtime environment for running the project

## Installation

To run the project locally, you need Node.js and a package manager like npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mijust/portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   (Alternatively: `yarn` or `pnpm install` or `bun install`)

## Development

Start the development server with one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Alternatively:
```bash
yarn dev
```
```bash
pnpm dev
```
```bash
bun dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your changes in real-time. Begin working by editing the `app/page.tsx` file or other components; the page will automatically update.

## Deployment

The deployment is via Vercel, provided by the creator of Next.js. For more information about deployment, check out the [Next.js Deployment Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
