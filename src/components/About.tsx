          I am a passionate web developer and designer currently pursuing my degree at the Technical University Darmstadt.
          As a working student at Siemens in Operations & Engineering Standards, I gain valuable practical experience in technical and operational processes while pursuing web development as my creative outlet.

            My journey in web development started 2 years ago, and since then, I've had the opportunity to work on a
            diverse range of projects, from small business websites to complex web applications. I'm constantly learning
            and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the ever-evolving world of web
            development.

          When I'm not immersed in coding or University-work, you'll find me exploring the world through my lens. As an enthusiast photographer,
          I capture moments that tell stories and perspectives that others might miss.
